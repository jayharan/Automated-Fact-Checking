# Automated-Fact-Checking
Coursework for COMP0084 Information Retrieval and Data Mining University College London, 2019

## Project Description
The project tackled the FEVER fact verification task, Which involves using Wikipedia to classify facts as either "True", "False"
or "not enough info". This task involved
- relevant document retrieval
- evidence sentence selection
- claim veracity prediction

Relevant document retrieval was approached using search algorithms, a logistic regression was used to select relevant sentences
and then deep learning architectures were used for claim veracity prediction.

- Project_Description.pdf contains more information on the project and instructions on acquiring the data.
- Question 1-5 covers the data processing, summary statistics, relevant document retrieval and evidence sentence selection.
- Question 6 covers a simple baseline neural network.
- Question 8 covers a more bespoke architecture implemented for the task.
